# DiscordIntegration

Discord Integration offers a two way chat bridge between your Hytale server and Discord server. This mod also offers you the ability to link your in-game account to the discord bot.

## Requirements

- Java 25+
- Hytale Server API (`HytaleServer.jar`)

## Extensions by @NSD4rKn3SS

PS.: I did have to use AI help, because I'm merely a webdev and have only very basic Java experience.

### Additions:
 - Player death relay
 - Server online and shutdown relay
 - Update the config file with newly added or missing parameter options while keeping already set variables
 - Updating the Discord Channel topic automatically with current player count, it can also be disabled
